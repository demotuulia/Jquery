# Jquery


Here is some example code of [Jquery](https://github.com/demotuulia/Jquery/blob/main/currency.pdf).

 This is  class to handle currencies which belongs to a financical application I have created.
 This clas is used on the admin pages to manage currencies with
 Ajax and Jquery.
 It provides a list of existing currencies.
 The user can edit and add new currencies.
 Editing currencies happens in a jQeury UI dialog
 box and all transactions are done with Ajax.
